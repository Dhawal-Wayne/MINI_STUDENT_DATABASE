# MINI_STUDENT_DATABASE

CMakeLists.txt is provided

The C-Code takes the input records and creates n+2 BST's based on the (n-subjects + 1 Alphabetical + 1 Avg-Marks)

Basic Querying is implemented without a Query parser (USED switch case ;)

A bit of user authentication is provided (master_user==>root,password==>knight)

Quite a crude implementation for beginners to understand.

Feel free to modify and test!
